## SARS-CoV-2 nsP13 helicase inhibitors identification through data mining

An SGC Open Chemistry Networks Project devoted to the discovery and development of SARS-CoV-2 nsP13 helicase inhibitors. The outbreak of COVID-19 demonstrated the scarcity of drugs in the development pipeline to decrease the mortality and morbidity caused by the new pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 virus. Despite the improved diagnosis and screening processes, broad, directly-acting anticoronavirus drugs were not immediately available to treat viral infections. In response to this health threat, the Rapidly Emerging Antiviral Drug Discovery Initiative â€“ Antiviral Drug Discovery Center (READDI-AC) was established to develop a pipeline of oral, direct-acting antiviral hits, leads, and drug candidates with broad activity against alphaviruses, flaviviruses, coronaviruses, and filoviruses with high pandemic potential. Importantly, READDI-AC currently focuses on highly conserved viral RNA polymerase (RdRp), helicase (Hel), and proteases (Pro) that are essential for positive and/or negative strand emerging virus replication and pathogenesis.

You contribute synthetic chemistry and in return the SGC offers biology. Together we can generate tool compounds to understand biology and validate drug targets to help cure disease. Everything is open, with all content governed by a CC-BY-4.0 licence.

If this sounds interesting, and you agree to the simple https://www.thesgc.org/sgc-open-chemistry-networks/terms-of-use, you can get started.

For the science background, head to the wiki or check out the living paper that is being written here.

For answers to all the questions you have, go to the FAQs.

If you'd like to contact someone to talk about contributing, then write something in an Issue (see the tab above), which is a good way to communicate openly. (Issues describe what currently needs doing and act as a discussion forum - you need a Github account but it's super easy and not spammy. There's also an email address (chemistry@thesgc.org) you can use to ask questions. You can read more about all this in the "How To" Area
